## Advanced Lane Finding

Objective: Lane line identification is a critical part of building a self driving car. The goal here is to build a robust lane identification pipeline that identifies the lane boundaries in a video. This work builds on some [initial work](https://github.com/JovanSardinha/CarND-LaneLines-P1) and accounts for things like shadow, curvature of the lane line, and discrepancies that may be caused by camera distortion.
